    <h3>Letra:</h3>

    <p>Welcome to the room I hide in</p>
        <p>I'd invite you to stay but I'm tryna</p>
        <p>Get out of here</p>
        <br>
        <p>The windows see my pain they feel it</p>
        <p>The curtains know my name they scream it</p>
        <p>Get out of here</p>
        <br>
        <p>I don't know why I can never leave</p>
        <p>When all that I'm left with are memories</p>
        <p>I guess I want your ghost as my company</p>
        <br>
        <p>This house is full of the things we did</p>
        <p>But you're still ringing in my empty head</p>
        <p>I can't let go of the way we left</p>
        <p>I can't let go of you</p>
        <br>
        <p>And now I'm hanging on by a thread</p>
        <p>But you're still ringing in my empty head</p>
        <p>I can't let go of the way we left</p>
        <p>I can't let go of you</p>
        <br>
        <p>To the left and down the hallway</p>
        <p>Pictures hang from crooked nails</p>
        <p>Get out, get out</p>
        <p>I can't get out of here</p>
        <br>
        <p>The doors keep falling off I feel them</p>
        <p>The rooms have twisted thougts and I hear them</p>
        <p>Get out of here</p>
        <br>
        <p>I don't know why I can never leave</p>
        <p>When all that I'm left with are memories</p>
        <p>I guess I want your ghost as my company</p>
        <br>
        <p>This house is full of the things we did</p>
        <p>But you're still ringing in my empty head</p>
        <p>I can't let go of the way we left</p>
        <p>I can't let go of you</p>
        <br>
        </p>And now I'm hanging on by a thread</html>
        <p>But you're still ringing in my empty head</p>
        <p>I can't let go of the way we left</p>
        <p>I can't let go of you</p>
        <br>
        <p>And this house is full</p>
        <p>Of the things we did</p>
        <p>And my bed has known</p>
        <p>Every inch of your skin</p>
        <p>Well I can't let go</p>
        <p>Of the way that we left</p>
        <p>Now my bath it floods</p>
        <p>With your silhouette</p>
        <br>
        <p>This house is full of the things we did</p>
        <p>But you're still ringing in my empty head</p>
        <p>I can't let go of the way we left</p>
        <p>I can't let go of you</p>
        <br>
        <p>And now I'm hanging on by a thread</p>
        <p>But you're still ringing in my empty head</p>
        <p>I can't let go of the way we left</p>
        <p>I can't let go of you</p>
